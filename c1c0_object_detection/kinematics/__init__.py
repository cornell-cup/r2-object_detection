from . import collison_detection

# main things we want to be able to access from the kinematics package:
# 1) Assuming linearity function (should take in a starting angle position and a goal position)
# 2) Visualization (can be pretty basic to start with)
# 3) Collision detection functions later? Or at least some way to represent the obstacles after k-means algo
